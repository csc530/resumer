# resumer

save your skills, job experience and details to easily(?) build a resumé from them

[![demo](Resumer/demo.gif)](https://github.com/csc530/resumer/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## why?

well, you know, formatting in Word is just.. eeghh😵‍💫😵‍💫🥴, ya
and sometimes I want to curate the jobs on the resume or just the look without all the work

### why not x

honestly, you probably should use *x* 🤷🏿‍♂️ (the other tool/app)
whatever is best and easiest for you😽
(but if you love being in you command line then this could be for you??)

# resumer

save your job details and easily build a resume from them

a user first cli app.

## why?

well you know formatting in Word is just eeghh😵‍💫😵‍💫🥴, ya
and I hate the copy paste from my *plain* docx resume to online formatters, just to get paywalled😑
so I made this and hopefully i don't quit and it turns into something nice :)

# resumer
save your job details and easily build a résumé from them

## why?

well, you know, formatting in Word is just eeghh😵‍💫😵‍💫🥴, ya
and I hate the copy-paste from my *plain* docx resume to online formatters, just to get paywalled😑,
so I made this and hopefully i don't quit, and it turns into something nice :)
